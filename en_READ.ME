📝 Guide: Creating and Running Your First DNS Resolver in Python

1. Create the script file

In the terminal, create the file:

nano script8.1.py

2. Add the Python code

Paste the following code:

#!/usr/bin/python3
# Educational DNS Resolver in Python
# Usage: python3 script8.1.py <domain>

import socket
import sys

# Check if the domain was provided as an argument
if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    print("Usage: python3 script8.1.py <domain>")
    sys.exit(1)

host = sys.argv[1]

# Returns the IP corresponding to the domain
print(f"{host} ---> {socket.gethostbyname(host)}")


⚠️ Note: This script is for educational purposes only and should not be used to collect information without authorization.

3. Run the script
python3 script8.1.py example.com

4. Example output
example.com ---> 93.184.216.34

👉 What you learned here

socket.gethostbyname() → resolves a domain to its IP address.

sys.argv → captures command-line arguments.

len(sys.argv) → validates the number of arguments provided.

sys.exit() → exits the script when necessary.
